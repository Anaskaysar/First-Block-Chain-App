# First-Block-Chain-App

Here I am using JAVA script for developing my first BlockChain App.

# Creating First Block

Creating first block is the first step towards my blockchain deveopment. A block has mainly three different things. The data it contains, a hash and previous hash. 

When at the very begining a block is manually created and doesn't have any hash is called Genesis Block. It's has is represented with 0...

In our first block we used a node library for generating hash. It is named "crypto-js". we have used sha256 though there are many available for this task.
